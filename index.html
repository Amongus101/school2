        <h1> Hi! </h1>
        <div class="line"> </div>
        <p>This school is GREAT! Teachers are professional, helpful and very responsive - they responded to all my emails within a day or so. My daughter attends this school since grade 6 and so far she had not reported any issues.(a parent said) Welcome to the Marshall Middle School. This handbook is designed to provide you with the
            information you need to be successful. We encourage you to be an active learner and productive
            member of our “Community of Independent Learners”.
            It is our goal to provide you with the necessary knowledge and skills that you will need to be
            successful in your future educational pursuits. You will learn in your classes, through your
            interactions with the school community, and through exploring a variety of activities, programs,
            and opportunities. Please take advantage of all we have to offer.
            During the 2020-2021 school year, Billerica Public Schools may be implementing different
            learning models due to a COVID-19 outbreak. The models include in-person with safety
            precautions, hybrid model of in-person with safety precautions and remote learning, and full
            remote learning. Families may be asked to follow any of these models throughout the year.
            Families will also have some choice in the model in which their children engage. With any of the
            models that involve in-person instruction, procedures for staff and students (e.g. arrival and
            dismissal times) in the school buildings may be subject to change in order to be in compliance
            with safety protocols. Please see the district’s 2020 School Reopening Plan for details about what
            these models will look like.
            We hope that you will invest in your education and development by being responsible school
            citizens, treating people with kindness and respect, and taking great pride in your school. We will
            challenge you to become the “Best version of yourself.” You will have a great experience at the
            Marshall Middle School. The entire staff at the Marshall Middle School is here to support you and
            help you have a positive middle school experience. We place tremendous value on being part of
            your education and look forward to the 2020-2021 school year.
